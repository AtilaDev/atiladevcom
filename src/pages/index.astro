  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Hey! I'm Leandro Favre.</h1>
  <p class="mb-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed text-lg max-w-2xl">
    I'm from <span class="font-bold">Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·</span> and I'm passionate about
    building mobile and web applications from the ground up, as well as contributing
    to existing projects. I've been working in software development since 2017. I'm
    naturally curious and continuously explore new tools to enhance and streamline
    my workflow.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-white/80 leading-relaxed text-lg max-w-2xl">
    I have created several open-source tools, including <strong>Icons</strong> (for
    Expo),
    <strong>Directory</strong> (an Expo Google Fonts searcher), and <strong
      >useCalendar</strong
    >
    (a hook for Expo Calendar), among others.
